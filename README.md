## Workflow (proposed by Lotte)
Please create a dedicated branch for each task and push your changes to that branch. Once you've completed your task, open a pull request so that we can all review the changes. Once we've alle ACKed them, you can merge them into the ``master`` branch.

### Example
Say I want to add and reorder a section about metrics. The workflow would be as follows:  

1) create and check out branch

	git checkout -b metrics_reordering

2) push branch to gitHub so that everyone can see them  
 
	git push -u origin metrics_reordering

3) Edit, push to gitHub, edit, ...

4) When you're done, open pull request by choosing your branch from the drop-down menu and clicking “open pull request”

5) Discuss & merge after ACKs by clicking the big green button.
